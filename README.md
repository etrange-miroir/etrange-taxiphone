## Taxiphone

Taxiphone is a [Leaflabs Maple](http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/) sketch to detect which number has been composed on a rotary phone and send the according MIDI message in order to control the sounds that are played with Ableton Live.

It can be easily adapted to [Arduino](http://arduino.cc).

It was developed with [Etrange Miroir](http://etrangemiroir.org) for the scenographic installation [L'Ã©trange taxiphone](http://etrangemiroir.org/etrange_taxiphone.html)
